\section*{Objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Familiarization with Inheritance. 
    \item To understand the concept of Single and Multi level inheritance in OOP. 
    \item To solve various problems in order to comprehend the topics.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Example 1}
A C++ program to demonstrate the single level inheritance.

\subsection*{Code}

\section*{Example 2}
A C++ program to demonstrate the Multilevel Inheritance.

\subsection*{Code}
\lstinputlisting[language=C++]{../Exp-2.cpp}

\section*{Practice 1}
Write a C++ program to add two numbers. Accept these two numbers from the user in base class and display the sum of these two numbers in derived class.

\subsection*{Code}
\lstinputlisting[language=C++]{../Prac-1.cpp}

\subsection*{Output}
\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Prac-1.png}
    \caption{Output of Prac-1.cpp}
\end{figure}


\FloatBarrier
\section*{Practice 2}
Write a C++ program to calculate the percentage of a student. Accept the marks of five subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Math, Biology, and English) in base class. A class will be derived from the base class which includes a function to find the total marks obtained and another class derived from this first derived class which calculates and displays the percentage of student. \\ 
\underline{\textbf{Hints:} Use array for taking the marks of a student.}

\section*{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inheritance is a powerful feature in C++ that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class. 
    \item Single level inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class inherits properties and behavior from a single class. 
    \item Multi level inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class inherits properties and behavior from another class which in turn inherits from another class. 
    \item Inheritance is a powerful feature that allows code reusability and helps in reducing redundancy. 
    \item In this experiment, various problems were solved to understand the concept of inheritance in C++. 
    \item In Practice-2 problem, the base class constructor was called from the derived class constructor.
\end{itemize}
