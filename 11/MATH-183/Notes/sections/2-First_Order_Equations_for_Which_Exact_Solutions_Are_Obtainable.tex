\subsubsection{Standard Forms of First-Order Differential Equations}
The first-order differential equations may be expressed in either the \textbf{Derivative Form}
\begin{equation}
    \dv{y}{x} = f(x,y)
\end{equation}
or the \textbf{Differential Form}
\begin{equation}
    M(x,y) \: d{x} + N(x,y) \: d{y} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{example}{Standard Forms}
    
    The equation \[
        \dv{y}{x} = \frac{x^2 + y^2}{x-y}
    \]
    is the form (2.1.1). It may be written as \[
        (x^2 + y^2) \: dx + (y-x) \: dy = 0
    \] which is of the form (2.1.2). \\
    Again, the equation \[
        (\sin x + y) \: dx + (x + 3y) \: dy = 0
    \] is of the form (2.1.2), which can also be written as \[
    \dv{y}{x} = - \frac{\sin x + y}{x + 3y}
    \]
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Exact Differential Equations}

\begin{definition}{Exact Differential}
    
    Let $F$ be a function of two real variables such that  $F$ has continuous first partial derivatives in a domain $D$. The total differential $dF$ of the function $F$ is defined by the formula
    \[
        d{F(x,y)} = \pdv{F(x,y)}{x} \: dx + \pdv{F(x,y)}{y} \: dy
    \]
    for all $(x,y) \in D$.
\end{definition} \\~\\

Comparing $dF(x,y)$ with the form (2.1.2), we get
\[
    \pdv{F(x,y)}{x} = M(x,y) \;\;\; and \;\;\;
    \pdv{F(x,y)}{y} = N(x,y)
\]

\begin{example}{}
    
    Let $F$ be a function \[
        F(x,y) = xy^2 + 2x^3y
    \] for all real $(x,y)$. Then
    \[
        \pdv{F(x,y)}{x} = y^2 + 6x^2y ,\;\;\;
        \pdv{F(x,y)}{y} = 2xy + 2x^3
    \]
    and the total differential $dF$ is defined by \[
        dF(x,y) = (y^2 + 6x^2y) \: dx + (2xy + 2x^3) \: dy
    \]
    for all real $(x,y)$
\end{example}

\begin{definition}{Exact Differential Equation}
    
    The expression
    \begin{equation}
        M(x,y) \: d{x} + N(x,y) \: d{y}
    \end{equation}
    is called an exact differential in a domain $D$ if there exists a function $F$ of two real variables such that this expression equals the total differential $dF(x,y)$ for all $(x,y) \in D$. \\
    That is, expression (2.1.3) is an exact differential in $D$ if there exists a function $F$ such that
\[
    \pdv{F(x,y)}{x} = M(x,y) \;\;\; and \;\;\;
    \pdv{F(x,y)}{y} = N(x,y)
\]
for all $(x,y) \in D$. \\
If $M(x,y) \: d{x} + N(x,y) \: d{y}$ is an exact differential, then the differential equation
\[ M(x,y) \: d{x} + N(x,y) \: d{y} = 0 \]
is called an \textbf{Exact Differential Equation}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}{Exact Differential Equation}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If the DE $M(x,y) \: d{x} + N(x,y) \: d{y} = 0$ is exact in $D$, then
            \[ \forall (x,y)\in D, \;\;\; \pdv{M(x,y)}{y} = \pdv{N(x,y)}{x} \]
        \item Conversely, if 
            \[ \forall (x,y)\in D, \;\;\; \pdv{M(x,y)}{y} = \pdv{N(x,y)}{x} \]
        then the DE is exact in $D$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem} \\~\\

\underline{\textbf{Proof (1):}}
\begin{align*}
    \pdv{F(x,y)}{x} = M(x,y) \;\;\;&,\;\;\; \pdv{F(x,y)}{y} = N(x,y)  \\
    \frac{\partial^2 F(x,y)}{\partial x \partial y} = \pdv{M(x,y)}{y} \;\;\;&,\;\;\; \frac{\partial^2 F(x,y)}{\partial x \partial y} = \pdv{N(x,y)}{x}
\end{align*}
\[
    \because \frac{\partial^2 F(x,y)}{\partial y \partial x} = \frac{\partial^2 F(x,y)}{\partial x \partial y}
\] \[
    \therefore \pdv{M(x,y)}{y} = \pdv{N(x,y)}{x} \qed
\]

\subsubsection{The Solution of Exact Differential Equations}

\begin{theorem}{Solution of Exact DE}
    
    \\If $M(x,y) \: d{x} + N(x,y) \: d{y} = 0$ is exact in domain $D$, then
    \[
        \forall(x,y)\in D, \exists F(x,y) : \pdv{F(x,y)}{x} = M(x,y) \;\;\;and\;\;\;
        \pdv{F(x,y)}{y} = N(x,y)
    \]
    Then the equation may be written \[
        \pdv{F(x,y)}{x} \: d{x} + \pdv{F(x,y)}{y} \: d{y} = 0
    \] or simply, \[
        dF(x,y) = 0
    \]
    Here, $F(x,y) = c$ is a one-parameter family of solutions of this DE, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.
